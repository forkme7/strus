	<h1>Strus whiteboard</h1>
	<div id="whiteboarddescr">The Strus whiteboard is a page for brainstorming.
	Here we put our ideas and draw the first sketches of the near future of strus.
	You are welcome to work with us on the whiteboard.

		<div id="whiteboardheading">
			Planned&nbsp;articles on&nbsp;codeproject<br/>(SHORT-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">The following articles on <a href="codeproject.com">codeproject</a> are planned for the
			next weeks:
			<br/>- Show the <i>expandability</i> of the Strus core. Explain how to build
			modules for it. Introduce the interfaces for weighting functions, summarizers,
			expression joins. Do this also for the analyzer. 
			Introduce the interfaces for segmenters, tokenizers, normalizers, aggregators.
		</div>

		<div id="whiteboardheading">
			UIMA&nbsp;integration<br/>(MEDIUM-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">The Strus analyzer might be a good choice for small projects.
			It does not have too many dependencies. It has in my opinion some expressive 
			languages to describe document transformation. It is very efficient.
			<br/>But it has <i>limits</i>, there is a wall. Document processing is an extremely
			<i>competitive environment</i> with many mature solutions available.
			You cannot compete there without a strong focus on it and many man years of
			valuable development behind you.
			<br/>
			The Strus analyzer has also been developed as separated project, because
			this is not the ground to fight for Strus.
			<br/>One framework that looks very interesting is 
			<a href="https://uima.apache.org/">UIMA</a>. It would be interesting to build 
			a document processing chain with UIMA for feeding Strus.

	<div id="whiteboardrow">
		<div id="whiteboardheading">
			Cooperation<br/>(MEDIUM-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">
			Strus has already reached the limits, where it is 
			healthy for the project to be dependent on only one or two brains.
			<i>Sharing ideas</i> is the primary stimulation for development.
			A first step could be to find open source projects that probably need a search and try
			to integrate there.
			<br/>
			For <i>people out there</i> reading these lines: Please mail us (contact (at) project (dash) strus (dot) net)
			if you have problems, ideas or you are looking for cooperation.

	<div id="whiteboardrow">
		<div id="whiteboardheading">
			Introspection of&nbsp;Strus&nbsp;objects on&nbsp;client&nbsp;side<br/>(LONG-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">
			Something missing in strus is <i>introspection</i> of the data structures built 
			in a program (expression trees, function definitions, data loaded and processed etc.). 
			<br/>
			Because this seems to be an aspect on its own, we could implement an own
			proxy universe from StorageObjectBuilderInterface and AnalyzerObjectBuilderInterface,
			similarly to what strusModule (the module loader) or strusRpc does.
			Every object created would implement its method calls as redirect to the real
			method call and additionaly build some representation in a
			universe that is introspectable (an object tree).

			Stress tests<br/>(MEDIUM-TERM)

			Stress test have to be done more extensively on server hardware.
			Machines are needed and time.
