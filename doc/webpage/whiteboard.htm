	<div id="whiteboarddescr">The Strus whiteboard is a page for brainstorming.
	Here we put our ideas and draw the first sketches of the near future of strus.
	You are welcome to work with us on the whiteboard.

			The restriction to C++98 will be dropped and we will move to C++11.

		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">
			The strus language bindings are a nightmare from the maintainability point of view.
			Several problems have to be solved. The current solution is a too shaky base for that.

			Planned&nbsp;articles<br/>(MEDIUM-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">The following articles on <a href="codeproject.com">codeproject</a> are planned:
			<br/>- Show the <i>expandability</i> of the Strus analyzer with modules
			written in C++. Do it the same way as for the Strus core.
			Introduce the interfaces for segmenters, tokenizers, normalizers, aggregators.
			<br/>- Show how the project strusVector helps you to use vectors generated
			from word embeddings (word2vec and friends). We use brute force LSH with a two
			layer preselection with help of 2*64bit samples to reduce the number of cache lines loaded.
			It works well on about 10 million vectors as we demonstrate in the Wikipedia demo search.
			<br/>- Show how you can debug retrieval and summarization methods. Similar to Lucene, every
			method can attach debug information that can be displayed with the result.
			The demo search demonstrates it if you attach the parameter "&amp;m=debug" to the
			evalQuery.php URL.

		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">
			As a starting point for <i>Strus</i> projects, it could be nice to generate 
			analyzer configurations out of XML schemas.
