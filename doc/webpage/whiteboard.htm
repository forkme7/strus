		<div id="whiteboardcol">The following articles on <a href="codeproject.com">codeproject</a> are planned for the
			next weeks:
			<br/>- Show the <i>expandability</i> of the Strus analyzer with modules
			written in C++. Do it the same way as for the Strus core.
			Introduce the interfaces for segmenters, tokenizers, normalizers, aggregators.

			Introspection of&nbsp;Strus&nbsp;objects on&nbsp;client&nbsp;side<br/>(LONG-TERM)
		</div>
		<div id="whiteboardcol">
			Something missing in strus is <i>introspection</i> of the data structures built 
			in a program (expression trees, function definitions, data loaded and processed etc.). 
			<br/>
			Because this seems to be an aspect on its own, we could implement an own
			proxy universe from StorageObjectBuilderInterface and AnalyzerObjectBuilderInterface,
			similarly to what strusModule (the module loader) or strusRpc does.
			Every object created would implement its method calls as redirect to the real
			method call and additionaly build some representation in a
			universe that is introspectable (an object tree).
