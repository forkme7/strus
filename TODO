change check for only one database open to storage (it's a storage restriction, not a database restriction)
implement information extraction: variables attached to subexpressions. In the queryeval for every match collect the docnos of the subexpression variables and attach them to the list of match postings of this variable. Then create a postingIterator on them that can be passed to a summarizer
query weight not part of posting and not multiplied in by weighting function (but in accumulator -- remember classical IR queryweight * tf * idf)
check how expensive it is to calculate combined df's of features (number of documents, where all expression features occurr)
near operator
document AND operator for selections
interface queryeval program 
interface analyzer program
backup interface
implement use of peer storage interface and global statistics
query language
summarization with help of weighted union iterator
storage database interface
