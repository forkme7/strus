Description: Library implementing the storage of a text search engine
 Core library for a text search engine implementing the storage and
 the query evaluation. 
 Able to evaluate structured queries on unstructured text as well
 as implenting classical information retrieval.
 Independent from storage impementation. Current storage implementation
 is based on LevelDB.
 Strus defines information retrieval as evaluation of a query based on 3
 types of operations:
  * Fetching and joining of feature occurrencies (document/position number)
  * Weighting of documents based on the feature occurrencies
  * Summarization as extraction of content based on the query matches
