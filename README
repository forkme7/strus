strus
=====

Library for merging term occurrencies and ranking documents in information retrieval.
Able to evaluate structured queries on unstructured text as well as implenting classical
information retrieval.
Independent from storage impementation.

strus defines information retrieval as evaluation of a query as evaluation of a
program working with 3 types of interfaces:
	* Iterators on occurrencies defined as document number plus position number
	* Accumulators of document weights
	* Rankers to create a sorted ranked list of the N highest weighted elements of an accumulator

The program is created from a query string internally compiled to a the code of a 
virtual machine working with these types of interfaces.

The storage of terms the query evaluation is based on is implemented as interface with
a method to create create iterators on occurrencies of terms and to create
accumulators for document attributes.
