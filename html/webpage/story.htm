		<h2>What is strus ?</h2>
		<p>Strus is a set of libraries and tools to build the core of a scalable search engine.
		Core means that strus focuses only on some parts needed for building a search
		engine. Other components are just left to people or groups  
		for implementing them. Strus focusses on providing reasonable interfaces for these 
		components.
		</p><p>
		Here is list of components that are "outsourced" to avoid spending time on things
		where I am not able to provide a competitive solution:
		<ul>
		<li>The crawler (robot), that searches for documents in the the internet or an intranet,
		extracts and possibly transforms the content the ACLs for user rights is not part of 
		strus. 
		</li>
		<li>The document analyzer or indexer exists as a project, but it is not interlinked
		in an intrusive way with the storage code. There exist more sophisticated 
		solutions to analyze documents than the strusAnalyzer. So this component should
		be replacable without too much hassle.

		<li>
		The database used to

		<h2>Why to build yet another search engine ?</h2>
		<p>

		<h2>Personal motivation</h2>
		<p>The project <i>strus</i> started just out of frustration. I was working on a project
		that was doomed from the beginning for two years. After realising that it had to fail,
		I had to focus on finding a new job. Unfortunately this proved to be more difficult
		than I thought. I had to do something to keep myself spinning and so I started a
		this project dealing with a topic that I know by heart. I was working for ten 
		years in a company providing services for information retrieval and also implementing
		the core of the search engine for these services. So I knew what it was about and the
		problems I had to face. In september 2014 I started the project strus.
